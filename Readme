Our project contains 2 code files: Project.ipynb and Feature Analysis.ipynb

Ipython Notebook, sklearn and some other common python packages are needed to run the code. 

Project.ipynb takes hours to run and may occur kernel interrupt while running because of large dataset and large number of estimators in classifiers.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.
